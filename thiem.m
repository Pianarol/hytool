function T = thiem( q, s1,s2,r1,r2)%THIEM - Calculate the transmissivity with Thiem formula%% Syntax: T = thiem( q, s1, s2, r1, r2)%%   q  = pumping rate%   s1 = drawdown in piezometer 1%   s2 = drawdown in piezometer 2%   r1 = distance piezometer 1 to pumping well%   r2 = distance piezometer 2 to pumping well%% Description:%   Thiem function compute the transmissivity with the Thiem (1906) %   solution.%%   The Thiem method requires to know the pumping rate and the drawdown in%   two observation wells located at different distances from the pumping%   well.%% Example:%   T= thiem(q,s1,s2,r1,r2)%% See also: thiem_dmoT = q / (2*pi*(s1-s2)) * log(r2/r1);
