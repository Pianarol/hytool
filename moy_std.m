function T = moy_std( q, s0, l, rw)%THIEM - Calculate the transmissivity with Moye (1967) formula%% Syntax: T = moy_std( q, s0, l, rw)%%   q  = pumping rate%   s0 = drawdown %   l  = length of the section%   rw = radius of the well%% Description:%   The Moye (1967) formula is used to estimate the transmissivity during a%   pseudo-steady state injection test. It is based on the Dupuit formula %   for confined homogeneous aquifer and steady flow. In addition it%   assumes that the radius of influence of the test is equal to half of%   the length of the test section.%%   The method is known to overestimate the transmissivity. Errors of more%   than one order of magnitude are possible.%%  Reference: Moye, D.G. (1967) Diamond drilling for foundation%  exploration. Civil En. Trans., Inst. Eng. Australia.
