<h1>eha_dim</h1>
<p> Computes drawdown for stepdrawdown tests according to EdenHazel (1973) </p>
 
<h2>Syntax</h2>
<pre>s = eha_dim( p, t)
 
    p(1) = a  = slope of late time straight line in m
    p(2) = A1 = intercept of the first straight line (at Hn=0) in m
    p(3) = A2 = intercept of the second straight line (at Hn=0) in m
    p(4) = A2 = intercept of the second straight line (at Hn=0) in m
    etc.
 
    t = measured time 
    s = drawdown
 
</pre>
<h2>Description</h2>
<pre> 
    Computes the drawdown for a step drawdown test with the Eden and Hazel
    (1973) method. This solution consists in a series of straight lines
    having all the same slope (a) and different intercepts for each steps
    corresponding to a different pumping rate.
 
    As opposed to the Jacob straight line, the intercepts corresponds to
    the value of the drawdown obtained when the straight line toward is
    extended and crosses the vertical axis at Hn=0.
 
    Hn is a reduced time that accounts for all the variations of pumping
    rates. Hn is calculated by the eha_pre function.
 
  WARNING: eha_dim can be used only if eha_pre has been called before, in
     order to initialize the pumping rate history.
