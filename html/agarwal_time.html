<h1>agarwal_time</h1>
<p> Computes equivalent Agarwal (1980) time for recovery tests.</p>
 
<h2>Syntax</h2>
<pre>[ta,sa]=agarwal_time(tr,sr,d)
 
    ta = equivalent Agarwal (1980) time
    sa = drawdown corresponding to the Agarwal time
 
    tr = vector containing the time since the begining of the recovery
    sr = corresponding drawdown during the recovery
         the residual drawdown is defined as follows:
         sr(tr) = s(tp) - s(tr)
         It is equal to 0 when the the pumping stops and it increases
         progressively when the aquifer recovers its equilibrium.
 
    d  = describes the pumping periods. 
 
      Two options are possible:
       - for a single rate pumping test 
           d = tp = duration of the pumping period
 
       - for a multiple rate test  
           d = q  = matrix describing the pumping rate history
           The matrix q contains one line per pumping period, and two 
           columns:
              column 1 = time (since the begining of the test) at which the 
                         period ends
              column 2 = flow rate during the period

<h2>Description</h2>
<pre>
 
    Agarwal has shown in 1980 that recovery test can be interpreted with
    the same solutions than pumping test if one interprets the residual
    drawdown sr = s(t) - s(end of pumping) as a function of an equivalent
    time that is computed from the pumping rates history. The theory is
    based on the superposition principle.

    time effects when drawdown type curves are used to analyse pressure

<h2>Example</h2>
<pre>
    The following example shows how to compute the Agarwal time for the
    recovery after a constant rate test that lasted 1500 seconds.
 
    [ta,sa] = agarwal_time( tr, sr, 1500 ); 
 
    This other example shows how to compute the Agarwal time for the
    recovery after a three steps variable rate test. In that case, the
    matrix q specifies that the pumping rate was 1 m3/s during the first 1800
    seconds, then 2 m3/s for the time between 1800 and 8000 seconds, and
    then it was 0.6 m3/s until the end of the pumping period at 13000 s.
 
    q=[1800,1; 8000,2; 13000,0.6];
    [ta,sa] = agarwal_time( tr, sr, q );
